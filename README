Tool: R


Q1. Analyze the sample given in the file sample_1.txt. This sample contains 250 
observations from a Normally distributed random variable with 
standard deviation 2.6.  Create the following:
	a. 90% confidence interval for the expectation.
	b. 95% confidence interval for the expectation.
 
Q2. Two samples are given in files sample_2a.txt (113 observations) and 
sample_2b.txt (106 observations). These samples contain cholesterol levels for 
subjects of an experiment: One group was given an experimental drug (sample_2a), 
the other was not (sample_2b). The observations show the change in cholesterol 
levels after one month of treatment. Calculate the sample means for both samples, 
and create a 98% confidence interval for the difference between the means.  
Draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of the drug treatment.

Q3. The file sample_3.txt contains the points allowed by a local football team 
last season. Assume the numbers are normally distributed. Create a 95% confidence 
interval for the expectation of the number of points allowed per game (use the 
t-distribution).

Q4. The file sample_4.txt contains the points allowed by the local football team 
so far this season. Comparing this to the sample in part 3, create a 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in the expected value for points allowed per game, 
and draw a conclusion as to whether the team has improved this year. You may 
assume the numbers are normally distributed. (Use the t-distribution, unknown 
different variances).

Execution Steps:

Q1:
        source(<path_of_the_file_1.R>)
        sample_1("sample_1.txt", <standard_deviation>, <confidence_level>)

        Ex: 
        sample_1("sample_1.txt", 2.6, 90)
        sample_1("sample_1.txt", 2.6, 95)

Q2:
        source(<path_of_the_file_2.R>)
        sample_2("sample_2a.txt", "sample_2b.txt", <confidence_level>)

        Ex: 
        sample_2("sample_2a.txt", "sample_2b.txt", 98)

Q3:
        source(<path_of_the_file_3.R>)
        sample_3("sample_3.txt", <confidence_level>)

        Ex: 
        sample_3("sample_3.txt", 95)

Q4:
        source(<path_of_the_file_4.R>)
        sample_4("sample_3.txt", "sample_4.txt", <confidence_level>)

        Ex: 
        sample_4("sample_3.txt", "sample_4.txt", 95)
